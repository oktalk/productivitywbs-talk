# Being Productive with Bootstrap

---

## Notes

*Problems:*
Don't understand the grid system
Don't understand CSS
Think it all looks the same
It's too big and it just gets in the way
Want to be creative and do something out of the box

*Caution:*
Don't modify bootstrap.css

Structure: 
Lieable hero, Encounters roadblocks, Emerges transformed
Exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, denouement

What is = here's a road block
What could be = here's how you can overcome
... repeate
New bliss

I. INTRO
* Show the current problem and really play up how bad it is
** 

* Marvel at how greate it could be. Be the role modal for how your audience should feel



* Why do we need a front-end framework
* What you will get out of this talk
* Who is this talk for?
* What we will cover
